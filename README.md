Thank you to Hei by TOPPAN NEXT for the opportunity to work on this take-home assignment. It’s been a fun and refreshing exercise, and I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting some of the fundamentals of CSS after leaning heavily on TailwindCSS for my recent projects.

## 🕒 Time Taken
This project took approximately **3 hours** to complete.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- **CSS Refresher**: Working with raw CSS again was a great way to appreciate its nuances. Tailwind has been my go-to recently, but this reminded me of the beauty and flexibility of custom styles.
- **The Challenge of `<select>`**: The trickiest part was getting the `<select>` element to behave like the `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements. It's safe to say it didn’t play nice at first, but with some persistence and creativity, I got it sorted out. 💪

## 📚 What I Learned
- Reacquainted myself with CSS selectors and transitions.
- Gained a deeper understanding of how different HTML form elements behave and their styling quirks.

## ✨ Final Thoughts
This assignment was a great exercise, and I genuinely enjoyed working through the challenges. Thank you again for the opportunity—it’s always rewarding to step back and approach problems with a fresh perspective.

Looking forward to hearing from you! 😊
